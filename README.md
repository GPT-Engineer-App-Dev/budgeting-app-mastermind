# budgeting-app-mastermind

Create a budgeting app with the following:

1. A header with the app name
2. A form to add new transactions with fields for:
   - Date (date picker) 
   - Amount (number input)
   - Type (radio button for income/expense)
   - Category (dropdown with options like groceries, bills, salary, etc)
   - Description (text input)
   - "Add Transaction" submit button
3. Store transactions in component state for now. Initialize it with some dummy data.
4. A main content area to show a list of transactions in a table with columns for date, description, amount, type, category. 
5. Make the table responsive so it works on mobile.
